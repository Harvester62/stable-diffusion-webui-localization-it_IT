Italian localization of the Stable Diffusion Web UI, Scripts and Extensions

This is an ongoing work in progress. If anybody speaking Italian natively and with a knowledge in Machine Learning and Generative AI has better terms for the translations, he/she is welcome to let me know. 

Unfortunately, there are several descriptions/labels that are not correctly exported in the json template file, or at least not yet, so I decided to add them and translate them anyway inside the localization file, hoping that one day they might be used.
